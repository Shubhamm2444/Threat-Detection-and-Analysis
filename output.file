** The output of the provided code will be a table similar to the following, assuming the sample data remains unchanged:

```
   username     ip_address login_result  anomaly_score severity
0      user1  192.168.1.1       Success        -0.424405      Low
1      user1  192.168.1.1       Success        -0.424405      Low
2      user2      10.0.0.2       Success        -0.384380      Low
3      user3     172.16.0.1       Success        -0.434372      Low
4      user1  192.168.1.2       Success        -0.474398      Low
5      user4  203.0.113.19       Success        -0.524384      Low
```

**Explanation:**
- **username:** The username associated with the login attempt.
- **ip_address:** The IP address from which the login attempt originated.
- **login_result:** Whether the login attempt was successful or failed.
- **anomaly_score:** The score generated by the Isolation Forest model, indicating the degree of anomaly (lower scores suggest higher anomaly).
- **severity:** The severity level assigned based on the anomaly score and login attempts in the past hour (this is a basic example, and Expedia would likely have more refined criteria).

**Important Note:**
- This is a demonstration using sample data. Real login attempt data would likely contain different values.
- The severity levels are placeholders, and Expedia would need to define their own criteria based on risk factors and security policies.

**Integration with Expedia's Tools:**
The final step (not shown in the code) would involve integrating this script's output with Expedia's existing security tools (SIEM, ticketing system) for generating alerts and reports. This might involve exporting the DataFrame to a format (e.g., CSV, JSON) that can be ingested by those tools.

** Threat Detection and Analysis for Expedia's SOC
Project Goal: Develop a Python-based system to improve threat detection and analysis efficiency for Expedia's SOC analysts, focusing on suspicious login attempts.

** Ethical Considerations:
Data Privacy: Ensure log data anonymization or pseudonymization wherever possible.
False Positives: Minimize false positives through careful threshold tuning and anomaly detection selection.
Security: Securely handle log data with encryption and access control (least privilege) practices.

** Technical Approach:
Log Collection (Note: Integrate with Expedia's existing tools)

** Utilize a SIEM tool or custom script (depending on Expedia's setup) to collect login attempt logs.
Ensure logs capture essential details:
Timestamps
Usernames
IP addresses
Login result (success/failure)
User agent information
